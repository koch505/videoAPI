# This folder is for sample code featuring api.video's Python Client

Welcome! In this folder you will find a sample for all of the Python client's basic commands. If you need additional help, contact us in our [community forum](https://community.api.video). 

Samples cover every command for every endpoint. If you are looking up parameter information for an endpoint, we recommend that you use the client documentation. On occasion, the client changes the format of parameters described at [docs.api.video](https://docs.api.video) to be more Pythonic. (For example: If you use the API without a client and you wanted to create a player, parameters are written like so - enableApi, enableControls and so on. The client makes these more Pythonic by changing them to be enable_api, enable_controls. For best results, use the client documentation for the client.) 

If you want to contribute samples to this directory, please feel free to submit something. We do not allow changes to the client itself at this time, but samples using the client are welcome.
